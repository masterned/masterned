### Hello all!
My name is Spencer Dent.

I'm currently employed at Sunbelt Ford here in Sylvester, GA as their Internet and IT Manager.
I'm not doing much programming here, so being able to find an place where I can sharpen my skills would be greatly appreciated.

I have a BA in Computer Science from Covenant College and an MS of Applied Computer Science from the University of West Georgia.

I'm married to my wonderful wife, Brooke Dent, and we're looking forward to possibly moving to Jacksonville for more tech job opportunities, better restaurant options, and closer access to the beach.

As far as pet projects go, I'm still working on a friend's party game, but some of the nuance of it seems to be tripping into NP-hard problems.
*It's amazing how simple concepts can be incredibly hard to put into code sometimes...*
I'm also working on an RPG with my brother, but development has become quite slow with it as life has kept us both busy.

Right now, Rust is my absolute favorite programming language.
I stumbled upon it when I was looking for a language with cartain characteristics.
It's everything I wanted and so much more.
Due to my schooling, I'm quite familiar with Java (though I would not say I'm too fond of the language).
I also am fairly familiar with JavaScript (and TypeScript and PureScript), C#, Ruby, C, and Haskell.
I've dabbled in Angular, React, and Vue (though the frameworks are powerful, I tend to find myself falling back onto the vanilla languages underneath the frameworks), and a handful of school projects had me use Ruby on Rails and the .NET framework.

My hobbies include some D&D and working on my computer.
I currently run PopOS as a daily driver, but I will be switching over to Artix once my new laptop arrives.
I'd like to think of myself as being proficient in Linux.
But, I'm sure anyone else with experience in the OS knows, there's always so much more to learn.
