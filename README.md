### Welcome to my page.

If you're here, you probably already know me, but, in case you don't, I'm Spencer.

My short description is pretty much all you need to know about me.
I'm a Christian &ndash; though I may not be very good at showing it sometimes.
I'm married to my lovely wife Brooke, and we live here in Rockmart, GA.
I'm currently working at Aromatic Fragrances International as their Software Project Manager &ndash; acting as a liason between company management and our many software teams.
As such, I don't have a lot of time for programming myself, as the three titles I just mentioned above are definitely full-time positions.

As far as programming goes, taking a peek into my repos will give you sort of an idea of my experience.
In my undergrad, most of my classes were in Java, but I also worked on projects in Python 2.7, ANSI C, Standard ML, Haskell, Ruby, MySQL, Javascript, Prolog, and (if you're not a purist, you'd also count) HTML.
While in my master's program, I also had a chance to work in C#, Typescript, and SQL Server.
Outside of schooling, I picked up some Purescript and Rust (Rust being my favorite so far).
I find languages &ndash; both programming and human &ndash; to be absolutely facinating.

Well, you've read this far.
If you're curious which distro I use, I'm currently dabbling in NixOS.
I still have a handful of machines running Fedora. I've ran Pop-OS in the past (still looking forward to COSMIC's full release), as well as Ubuntu, a little bit of Mint and KDE Neon, and I've attempted to daily-drive an Artix install using Luke Smith's LARBS rice (I think I would have been more successful if I had molded the keybinds to my usage habits).
