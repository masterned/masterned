### Hello all!
My name is Spencer Dent.

I'm currently employed at Sunbelt Ford here in Sylvester, GA
as their Internet (and unofficial IT) Manager.
I'm not doing much programming here,
so being able to find an internship where I can sharpen the skills I went to school for
would be greatly appreciated.

I have a BA in Computer Science from Covenant College and an MS of Applied Computer Science from the University of West Georgia.

I'm engaged to my spectacular fiancee, Brooke Phillips,
and we're going to be married within the next couple of months.

As far as projects go, I -- along side of my brother and his best man -- am
working on a small party game to be played with a group of friends.
That same brother and I are also working on creating a larger-scale
(in a relative sense) RPG that represents the table-top games we've played with our friends.

I'm a fan of functional programming. Right now, I think PureScript may be my favorite language
(I know that really puts a label on me, haha), but I also enjoy vanilla JavaScript and TypeScript.
Pretty much all of my classes have been in Java (so I'm pretty tired of it, to be honest), and
I dabble in Python, C, C#, and Haskell. I think it would be fun to learn Erlang or possibly Elixir
-- but I'm not the biggest fan of Ruby syntax.
